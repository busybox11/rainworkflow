# Kobo Rsbuild Template

This is a starter template for a Web app built with Rsbuild for the built-in Kobo web browser.
It includes janky-yet-functional support for the very old and outdated QtWebKit-based engine that still ships with the device to this day in 2025.

Expect some weirdness and don't mind the ugly code and hacks. It works and that's already very surprising.

React 19 is fully functional, hot reloading works, and I didn't bother making the Rsbuild overlay and other dev tools to work. Maybe in the future...
